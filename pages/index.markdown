title: About Me
---

I am currently a research engineer with [Ascent Robotics][1] in Tokyo, and
focused on using AI to make the robots of tomorrow smarter.

I was a PhD Student at the Universit√© de Montpellier 2, doing my
research at the French-Japanese Joint Robotics Lab (JRL) in Tsukuba.
My research was focused on multi-contact optimal control, but my
research interests encompass various areas of computer science and mathematics,
such as numerical optimization, computational geometry, approximation theory and
machine learning.

My defence took place on November 14th 2017, the dissertation is
titled "On multi-contact dynamic motion using reduced models" and the PDF is
available from the [publications](publications.html) page.

Outside of the lab, I really like to go rock climbing or biking, but on
rainy days I thoroughly enjoy my Nintendo Switch (Currently playing Donkey
Kong Country : Tropical Freeze).
