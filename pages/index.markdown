title: About Me
---

I am a PhD Student at the Universit√© de Montpellier 2, currently doing my
research at the French-Japanese Joint Robotics Lab (JRL) in Tsukuba. I am
focused on compliant control, but my research interests encompass various
areas of computer science and mathematics.

Outside of the lab, I really like to go rock climbing or biking but I also love
staying at home and reading.
