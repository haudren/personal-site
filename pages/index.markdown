title: About Me
---

I am a PhD Student at the Universit√© de Montpellier 2, currently doing my
research at the French-Japanese Joint Robotics Lab (JRL) in Tsukuba. I am
focused on multi-contact optimal control, but my research interests
encompass various areas of computer science and mathematics, such as
numerical optimization, computational geometry and approximation theory.

My defence is scheduled to take place mid-november, the dissertation is
titled "On multi-contact dynamic motion using reduced models". I will
upload the final electronic version once the defence is passed. If you
would like to obtain a draft, simply contact me.

Outside of the lab, I really like to go rock climbing or biking, but on
rainy days I thoroughly enjoy my Nintendo Switch (Currently playing
Disgaea 5).
