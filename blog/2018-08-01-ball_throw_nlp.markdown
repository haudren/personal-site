title: Robotic ball throwing - Part 1 Non-Linear Programming with Casadi
---

Last month, I gave a talk at [Decoded #2][1] titled "Robotic Major League". As you can
guess, it was about playing baseball with robots. More specifically, pitching baseballs
with the [JacoÂ²][2] arm.

In the first part, I presented how to optimize throwing trajectories using Non-Linear
programming. In later posts, we will show how to achieve similar results using
Reinforcement Learning.
